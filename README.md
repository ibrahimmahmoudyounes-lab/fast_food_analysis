## 📊 Key Insights
- Fast-food consumption patterns vary slightly across groups but remain generally consistent.
- Calorie intake differences are limited across categories.
- BMI distributions are comparable across groups.
- Physical activity and sleep duration show moderate variation.
- Health and energy scores remain relatively stable.
- No strong evidence suggests major health differences driven solely by fast-food consumption in this dataset.
