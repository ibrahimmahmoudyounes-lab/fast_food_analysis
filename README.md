# fast_food_analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between fast-food consumption and various health and lifestyle indicators using Python data analysis and visualization tools.

The analysis explores patterns related to diet, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, energy levels, and general health across different demographic groups.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains anonymized records including:

- Gender
- Age
- Weekly fast-food consumption
- Daily calorie intake
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Physical activity hours
- Sleep duration
- Doctor visit frequency
- Digestive issues occurrence
- Overall health score
- Energy level score

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Analysis Performed
The project includes:

- Fast-food consumption distribution analysis
- Average calorie intake comparison
- BMI distribution and summary statistics
- Physical activity level comparison
- Sleep duration analysis
- Health score comparison
- Energy level comparison
- Doctor visit frequency analysis
- Digestive issues frequency analysis

---

## Key Insights
- Fast-food consumption patterns vary slightly across groups but remain generally consistent.
- Calorie intake differences are limited across categories.
- BMI distributions are comparable across groups.
- Physical activity and sleep duration show moderate variation.
- Health and energy scores remain relatively stable.
- No strong evidence suggests major health differences driven solely by fast-food consumption in this dataset.
