## Analysis Performed
The project includes:

- Average age comparison by gender
- Weekly fast-food consumption distribution
- Average daily calorie intake comparison
- BMI distribution analysis
- Physical activity level comparison
- Overall health score comparison
- Digestive issues frequency analysis
- Annual doctor visit comparison
- Sleep duration comparison
- Energy level comparison
- Statistical summaries for BMI and eating habits

## Key Insights
- Age distribution is nearly uniform across genders.
- Fast-food consumption patterns are similar among all groups.
- Daily calorie intake differences are minimal.
- BMI distribution shows comparable medians and spreads.
- Physical activity levels are slightly higher in some categories but overall similar.
- Health and energy scores remain consistent across genders.
- Sleep duration and doctor visit frequency show no strong variation.

Overall, gender differences do not strongly influence most lifestyle and health indicators in this dataset.
